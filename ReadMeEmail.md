Got it! Here's a clear and professional `README.md` for your **email notification module**, explaining what it does, how it's structured, and how someone else (like an interviewer or teammate) can run it:

```markdown
# 📬 Email Notification System for Trade Journal

This module adds an email automation feature to the existing FastAPI-based trading journal. Whenever a user uploads a trade, an email is sent with trade details and an AI-generated summary using DeepSeek or Claude.

---

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Sends an automated trade summary email using **SendGrid**
- ✅ Uses **Jinja2** templates for clean HTML email formatting
- ✅ Generates custom summaries with an AI model (DeepSeek/Claude)
- ✅ Clean modular structure inside the `email/` folder
- ✅ Easy to integrate with the existing FastAPI upload flow

## 📁 Folder Structure

```

email_utils/                   # Renamed to avoid conflicts with Python's built-in email module
├── sendgrid\_client.py        # Handles sending emails with SendGrid
├── trade\_summary.py          # AI-based trade summary generator
├── templates/
│   └── trade\_email.html      # Jinja2 email template
.env                          # Store API keys and config

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install sendgrid jinja2 python-dotenv
````

---

### 2. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following:

```env
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
FROM_EMAIL=you@yourdomain.com
TO_EMAIL=receiver@example.com
```

---

### 3. How It Works

When a trade is uploaded:

1. `trade_summary.py` generates a custom summary (via Claude or DeepSeek).
2. `sendgrid_client.py` loads the `trade_email.html` template and fills it with trade data + summary.
3. An email is sent using the SendGrid API.
4. All of this happens in the background using FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks`.

---

## 🛠️ Example Integration in FastAPI

In `ui_server.py`:

```python
from fastapi import BackgroundTasks
from email_utils.sendgrid_client import send_trade_email
from email_utils.trade_summary import summarize_trade

@app.post("/extract-trade-upload")
async def extract_and_upload_trade(..., background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    trade_data = extracted_dict  # From image OCR
    summary = summarize_trade(trade_data)
    background_tasks.add_task(send_trade_email, trade_data, summary)
    return {"message": "Trade uploaded and email sent."}
```

---

## 🧪 Test It

1. Run the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn ui_server:app --reload
```

2. Upload a test trade via `/docs` Swagger UI.
3. Check your inbox for the summary email.

---

## ✨ Future Additions (Optional)

* Log trade upload events to **Klaviyo**
* Add support for multiple users (dynamic `TO_EMAIL`)
* Let users customize notification preferences
